Make note that packs work with this versions of render piplines which are suitable for unity 2022.2+
-14.0 universal rendering pipline (URP) for unity 2022.2 or higer
-14.0 High Definition rendering pipline (HD RP) for unity 2022.2 or higher

Use 14.0 compatibility pack for all higher versions.
To setup such version simply chose  proper urp or hd  version in package manager and install it import our asset and then proper compatibility pack
We advice to setup fresh unity project and chose hd or urp pipline at start. 
It's very difficult to setup render pipline yourself in engine and upgrade standard project.
